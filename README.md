## Tell me more, please!

As you wish. SNext is made with JavaScript, the same language that Scratch 3.0 runs off of. Games can be sumbitted to it, and if approved, they'll go on a server which can be accessed via the included shop. You can then download these games or apps and play them offline or online through a little UI magic and SNConnect!

## What do I need to run SNext?

SNext is now an ElectronJS executable, so that means all the dependencies come packaged with it. That's a good thing for you, since all you need is that now! You can get the lastest version from the releases section to the right.

## Wait a minute. Isn't this just Turbowarp then?

Well, not quite. First of all, SNext isn't an editor.. Although we now have our own editor called [SN-Edit](https://cube-enix.github.io/sn-edit/). Second, this is a console. Not an *emulator*, a *console*. We have our own system, with our own code, that has its own features. Also, does TurboWarp have a custom server running to host games? Ok, maybe they do, but it isn't as cool as ours!

## Wow, this sounds fun! How do I add my game to the console?

You can apply for launch title status *right now!* Just head to [this link](https://forms.gle/Rbt1ELbr8HPgEh2q9). You can also join our Discord, [here](https://discord.gg/mqGKmRw9MY).

## Installation

1. Download the files.
2. Make sure you have both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) ready.
3. Clone the repo/download it into a folder on your system.
4. (WINDOWS ONLY)  Navigate to the directory that you downloaded/cloned SNext to. Then right click on the file called `install.ps1` and click on 'Run with Powershell'. If you get an error about security, see [this](https://www.danielengberg.com/powershell-check-execution-policy/).
4. (LINUX ONLY) Navigate to the directory that you downloaded/cloned SNext to. Then open it in the terminal and run: `sh install.sh`.
5. Navagate to the directory that you downloaded/cloned SNext to. Then, navigate to `src` and run `npm start`.
**(Note: The Linux Build is relativly buggy. For best performance ~~grab a glass and~~ use Wine for now.)**

Please note that you'll get an error, stating that there were no files to run. **THIS IS INTENDED BEHAVIOUR. DO NOT REPORT THIS AS A BUG. SNEXT  WILL STILL COMPILE SUCCESSFULLY.**
