# Scratch-Next

An open-source Scratch console.

## Tell me more, please!

As you wish. Scratch-Next is made with JavaScript, the same language that Scratch 3.0 runs off of. Games can be sumbitted to it, and if approved, they'll go on a server which can be accessed via the included shop. You can then download these games or apps and play them offline or online through a little UI magic and sb-edit, a JavaScript project that can convert .sb3 files to .js!

## What do I need to run Scratch-Next?

Scratch-Next requires Node.js to run. However, it's currently a WIP, so there isn't exactly *much* to run with Node right now. If you want to use it in the future, though, make sure to snag a copy of the latest LTS version from the Node.js website!
