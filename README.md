# Scratch-Next

An open-source Scratch console.

## Tell me more, please!

As you wish. Scratch-Next is made with JavaScript, the same language that Scratch 3.0 runs off of. Games can be sumbitted to it, and if approved, they'll go on a server which can be accessed via the included shop. You can then download these games or apps and play them offline or online through a little UI magic and sb-edit, a JavaScript project that can convert .sb3 files to .js!

## What do I need to run Scratch-Next?

Scratch-Next requires Node.js to run. However, it's currently a WIP, so there isn't exactly *much* to run with Node right now. If you want to use it in the future, though, make sure to snag a copy of the latest LTS version from the Node.js website!

## Wait a minute. Isn't this just Turbowarp then?

Well, not quite. First of all, ScratchNext isn't an editor.. We don't have custom firmware to make games with, so you'll have to live with boring old [Turbowarp](https://turbowarp.org) for now. Second, this is a console. Not an *emulator*, a *console*. We have our own system, with our own code, that has its own features. Also, does TurboWarp have a custom server running to host games? Ok, maybe they do, but it isn't as cool as ours!

## Wow this sounds fun! How do I add my game to the console?

You can apply for launch title status *right now!* Just head to [this link](https://forms.gle/Rbt1ELbr8HPgEh2q9). You can also join our Discord, [here](https://discord.gg/mqGKmRw9MY).
