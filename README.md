# Scratch-Next

An open-source Scratch console.

## Tell me more, please!

As you wish. Scratch-Next is made with JavaScript, the same language that Scratch 3.0 runs off of. Games can be sumbitted to it, and if approved, they'll go on a server which can be accessed via the included shop. You can then download these games or apps and play them offline or online through a little UI magic and sb-edit, a JavaScript project that can convert .sb3 files to .js!

## What do I need to run Scratch-Next?

Scratch-Next requires Node.js to run. However, it's currently a WIP, so there isn't exactly *much* to run with Node right now. If you want to use it in the future, though, make sure to snag a copy of the latest LTS version from the Node.js website!

## Wait a minute. Isn't this just Turbowarp then?

Well not quite. First up ScratchNext isn't an editor. We don't have our own editor yet so you'll have to live with boring old [Turbowarp](https://turbowarp.org) for editing your projects in Javascript. Second this is a Console. That means we don't launch games like an emulator, instead we have our own system that has its own features. Also Turbowarp doesn't host their games on a cool server like us.

## Wow this sounds fun! How do I add my game to the console?

Right now our title applications are open and you can apply [here](https://forms.gle/Rbt1ELbr8HPgEh2q9). You can also join our discord server for more info and tool.

## Installation

Currently you can just download the files unzip it and run the html file in the **UI** folder.
